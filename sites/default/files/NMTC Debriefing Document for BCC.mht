<P><U>Phase I Review:</U></P>
<DIR>
<LI>The Fund=92s review process required three reviewers to =
independently review=20
and evaluate each application. The reviewers included Fund staff, other =
federal=20
agency staff working in other community development finance programs, =
and=20
private sector members of the community development finance community. =
The=20
private sector reviewers were selected on factors such as their =
knowledge of=20
community and economic development finance and experience in business or =
real=20
estate finance, business counseling, secondary market transactions, or =
financing=20
of community-based organizations. The Fund carefully screened each =
reviewer to=20
identify any potential conflicts of interest with applicants. The Fund =
provided=20
each reviewer with detailed descriptions of what constituted a conflict =
of=20
interest, and each reviewer was required to sign a certification that he =
or she=20
had disclosed all conflicts of interest to the Fund. Reviewers were also =

required to sign a confidentiality agreement stating that they would not =
reveal=20
any information obtained from the Fund during the review process.<BR>
<LI>The Fund provided reviewers with 1 and =BD days of focused training =
to prepare=20
them for the review process. The Fund also provided reviewers with =
guidelines to=20
assist them in scoring each application. <BR>
<LI>In scoring each application, reviewers rated each of the four =
evaluation=20
sections (Business Strategy, Capitalization Strategy, Management =
Capacity and=20
Community Impact) as follows: Weak (0-5 points); Limited (6-10 points); =
Average=20
(11-15 points); Good (16-20 points); and Excellent (21-25 points).<BR>
<LI>In addition, reviewers rated applicants with respect to two =
statutory=20
priorities: (i) up to 5 points for demonstrating a track record of =
serving=20
disadvantaged businesses or communities; and (ii) 5 points for =
committing to=20
invest substantially all of the proceeds from its qualified equity =
investments=20
in unrelated entities.<BR>
<LI>In addition to evaluating and scoring each application, reviewers =
were=20
required to recommend an allocation amount based on the information =
provided in=20
the application. Reviewers were instructed to recommend both three-year =
and=20
five-year allocation amounts, based on the amount of capital the =
reviewer=20
determined the applicant could reasonably raise and disburse over a =
three-year=20
and five-year period, respectively.<BR></LI></DIR><U>Panel-Phase =
Review:<BR></U>
<DIR>
<LI>In the second stage of the process, an Allocation Recommendation =
Panel=20
comprised of Fund staff reviewed the first phase reviewers=92 comments =
and=20
recommendations. <BR>
<LI>In order to be considered for an allocation, an application had to =
achieve:=20
1) an aggregate base score (without including priority points) of at =
least 216=20
points, which approximates the middle of the =93good=94 range based on a =
scoring=20
scale of weak, limited, average, good and excellent; and 2) an aggregate =
base=20
score of at least 48 points in each of the four-application evaluation=20
criterion, which approximates the low end of the =93good=94 range. Thus, =
an=20
application with scores in the =93good=94 range in three of the four =
criteria, but=20
an =93average=94 score in the fourth criterion, could not receive an =
allocation.=20
<BR>
<LI>A statistical review was conducted to identify anomalous scores. An=20
anomalous base score was deemed to have occurred for an application =
whenever one=20
of the three reviewers=92 base scores (total score minus priority =
points) varied=20
significantly from the median of the three reviewers=92 base scores. An =
anomalous=20
section score was deemed to have occurred for an application whenever =
one of the=20
three reviewers=92 section scores, in one or more of the four sections, =
varied=20
significantly from the median of the three reviewers=92 section scores. =
In cases=20
where there was an anomalous first phase reviewer score that would have=20
negatively impacted the ability of that applicant (or, in the case of a =
high=20
score anomaly, any other applicant that scored below it) to receive an=20
allocation, the comments and recommendations of a fourth independent =
reviewer=20
were used to determine whether the anomalous score should be replaced. =
<BR>
<LI>For each application, panelists reviewed the scores, comments and=20
recommended 3-year allocation amounts provided by each of the first =
phase=20
reviewers. Given the significant interest in the NMTC Program this year, =
the=20
Fund determined that awarding allocations based upon the 3-year =
recommended=20
allocation amounts would be the most effective way to ensure a fair =
distribution=20
of allocations to as many of the most qualified candidates as possible. =
<BR>
<LI>The panel also reviewed a variety of compliance, eligibility, due =
diligence=20
and regulatory matters. Included in this review were (i) checks to =
determine=20
whether any applicants that have been awarded funds through other Fund =
programs=20
were compliant with the award requirements, (ii) verification that the=20
applicants=92 investor letters were consistent with the capitalization =
information=20
provided in their applications, and (iii) consultation with the IRS with =
respect=20
to any applicant that proposed a business strategy that may not be =
permitted=20
under the NMTC Program regulations.<BR></LI></DIR><U>Selection of=20
Allocatees:</U>=20
<DIR>
<LI>After the panel phase of the review process was completed and all =
scoring=20
anomalies resolved, the rank order list of applicants and the =
recommended 3-year=20
allocation amounts were forwarded to the Selecting Official (NMTC =
Program=20
Manager). The Selecting Official reviewed the rank order list and the=20
recommendations, and decided whether to accept or modify the panel=92s=20
recommendations. <BR>
<LI>In the event the Selecting Official=92s decision reversed the =
panel=92s=20
recommendation or varied considerably from the panel=92s recommended =
allocation,=20
the Reviewing Official (Deputy Director) reviewed the application file =
and=20
either accepted the recommendation or modified it. <BR>
<LI>The Selecting Official/Reviewing Official reviewed each application, =
in rank=20
order beginning with the application with the highest aggregate total =
score=20
(inclusive of priority points), and made allocation determinations until =
there=20
was no allocation authority remaining <BR>
<LI>The Fund=92s Awards Management unit checked the General Services=20
Administration=92s list of debarred organizations to confirm that =
neither the=20
allocatees nor their parent companies were debarred from participating =
in any=20
federal programs. <BR>
<LI>Per the Fund=92s allocation application evaluation policies and =
procedures,=20
the Selecting Official=92s (and, as the case may be, the Reviewing =
Official=92s)=20
allocation decisions are final. </LI></DIR>
<P><STRONG>Part II. Characterstics of Your Specific=20
Application</STRONG><BR><BR><U>A. Phase I Review Scores</U><BR><BR>For =
each of=20
the four primary review criteria (Business Strategy, Capitalization =
Strategy,=20
Management Capacity, Community Impact), applicants were scored by each =
of three=20
first-phase reviewers as: weak (0-5 points); limited (6-10 points); =
average=20
(11-15 points); good (16-20 points); or excellent (21-25 points). In =
order to be=20
considered for an allocation of tax credits, an application had to: 1) =
receive=20
an aggregate section score in at least the lower portion of the =
=93good=94 range (48=20
points or above) under each of the four review criteria; and 2) receive =
an=20
overall aggregate base score (the total score prior to the addition of =
any=20
priority points) in at least the middle portion of the =93good=94 range =
(216 points=20
or above). Please note, however, that receipt of scores in the requisite =
=93good=94=20
ranges as outlined above did not ensure that an applicant would receive =
an=20
allocation. The Fund only had the authority to issue up to $2.5 billion =
in=20
equity for which NMTCs could be claimed and, since the number of =
applicants=20
scoring in the requisite ranges for an allocation award exceeded the =
available=20
allocation authority, many applicants scoring in the =93good=94 range =
did not=20
receive an allocation. </P>

<P><U>B. First Phase Reviewers - Compelling Factors for=20
Recommendation:</U></P>Based on comments provided by the first phase =
reviewers=20
of your application, the compelling factors forming the basis for the =
reviewers=92=20
recommendations are as follows:=20
<P><B>Reviewer One:</B> The applicant's business model will create =
leverage,=20
spreading the economic benefit of its NMTC allocation up to an =
additional $450=20
million in investments. The applicant has challenged investors to match=20
investment with additional low-income community loans. Additionally, the =

applicant has a very low default rate (in a 100% low-income community=20
portfolio). It is also clearly considering the impact of this activity =
on its=20
overall operations, and anticipates that its business model will =
increase=20
self-sustainability margin by 50%. Lastly, the applicant is grounded in=20
communities. Its entire portfolio is in low-income communities, =
generating=20
important asset growth to community-based groups and businesses.=20
<P>However, there is a question about whether the deal truly adds value =
to the=20
NMTC. Despite the leverage strategy and partnership with investors =
beyond NMTC,=20
the deal is essentially a liquidation of banks through the purchase of =
loans=20
made in the past. Additionally, there is no specific information =
regarding the=20
relationship between past track record and projections (i.e., there was =
no=20
indication of geographic expansion in the application, which may help =
generate=20
new business to meet goals, hedge against economic slowdowns). Most of =
the=20
applicant's activities and leaders are Boston-based, even though the =
fund is=20
statewide, and applied as a national (more than 7-state) lender. All =
examples of=20
loans, leaders, and track record showed a strong Boston bias. Activities =
and=20
expertise in other geographic areas should have been illustrated.=20
<P>With regard to the applicant's Capitalization Strategy, no previous =
investor=20
has invested more than 13% of the allocation request. Therefore, NMTC =
investors=20
will be tremendously out of proportion to other investors, potentially =
creating=20
undue influence on other operations and decision-making. Lastly, from a=20
management perspective, the applicant has new staff, and with heightened =
growth=20
comes intense activity and need for team efficiencies, such as comfort, =
trust=20
and familiarity. The applicant's projected doubling of growth will =
continue to=20
challenge that relatively new team. &nbsp;</P>
<P><B>Reviewer Two:</B> The applicant proposed an excellent model to =
leverage=20
private capital to low-income communities. The 4.5 to 1 leverage factor =
is a=20
strong use of NMTCs. BCC has developed a model that is replicable and =
fosters=20
CDFI financial autonomy. A =93win-win=94 all around. Additionally, the =
management=20
and board are very qualified, and have a successful track record of =
investing in=20
low-income communities. The applicant could face a problem if the =
capitalization=20
transactions are not consummated with Fleet and Citizens (the two bank =
investors=20
identified), and if there are no other banks that elect to participate. =
However,=20
this risk seems low.&nbsp;</P>
<P><B>Reviewer Three:</B> The applicant proposed a brilliant and =
potentially=20
replicable structure for NMTC investors, which addresses both the =
investors=92=20
concerns and leverages the impact of the NMTC. The applicant has an =
excellent=20
historical lending performance; senior management has longevity and an=20
innovative reputation; and the applicant has community commitment as =
well as a=20
likelihood of significant impact in the Massachusetts area primarily.=20
<P>However, the application lacks specificity on some aspects like the=20
compliance and monitoring of $200 million in loans to be made by bank =
investors.=20
The applicant should have provided more information on the conditions =
under=20
which the investing banks will purchase the applicant's originated =
loans, and on=20
the $200 million that the banks are being asked to lend. Furthermore,=20
notwithstanding the superior quality of the strategy, management has =
limited=20
track record in raising market-return funding. There are also areas of =
concern=20
with the current staffing. The CFO is new following a CFO who =
under-performed,=20
and the senior lending officer position is in the process of being =
filled. These=20
are two positions that will be key to growth and steadiness in plan=20
implementation. A number of other key staff members have been on board =
for less=20
than 3 years. These issues suggest some vulnerability in an otherwise =
reasonable=20
challenge for management. There is also little information on how the =
applicant=20
intends to service transactions in other communities outside of Boston =
and the=20
state of Massachusetts, and insufficient information on how staff will =
be=20
arranged to handle the expanding volume.&nbsp;</P>
<P><STRONG>Part III. Characteristics of an =93Excellent=94 =
Application</STRONG>=20
<P>In order to receive a score in the =93excellent=94 range in each of =
the four=20
review criteria, applicants generally needed to demonstrate the =
following=20
characteristics:=20
<P><STRONG>Business Strategy</STRONG>=20
<P>The Business Strategy should demonstrate that the applicant will =
deploy debt=20
or investment capital, or offer products and services, which: 1) have =
been=20
clearly designed to meet the articulated needs of underserved markets; =
2) have=20
features that offer flexible terms/conditions or offer non-traditional =
benefits;=20
and 3) proactively target customers or partners that typically lack =
access to=20
conventional sources of capital. The Business Strategy should propose =
the=20
development of new products/services that offer a variety of features =
not=20
currently provided; propose a significant increase in volume of existing =

products and/or services; or propose a strategy that meets the needs of =
LICs=20
that have a significantly higher level of distress than LICs currently =
being=20
served. Financial Counseling and Other Services should be offered. The =
Applicant=20
(or its Controlling Entity) should demonstrate a consistently strong, =
successful=20
track record during each of the past 5 years of providing products, =
services, or=20
Financial Counseling and Other Services. This track record should =
indicate that=20
it is highly likely that the applicant will be successful in deploying =
equity as=20
projected. The Applicant should present an extremely strong case that=20
demonstrates the value-added benefit of using the NMTC (per Q#26 of the=20
application). The Applicant should present a well-designed strategy for =
locating=20
qualifying activities based primarily on prior performance. Projected =
Annual=20
Activity Levels (Tables B1-E1) should show that most of activity will =
occur by=20
2005, but majority occurs between 2002-2003 (i.e., 1st full year of =
allocation=20
period); and assumptions (see Q31) should be provided to document demand =
such=20
that pipeline deals are almost guaranteed to convert to closed deals.=20
<P><STRONG>Capitalization Strategy</STRONG>=20
<P>The applicant should demonstrate that it has raised (either through=20
commitments or letters of interest/intent) 100 percent of the total =
amount of=20
allocation requested [as specified in Tables G1 and G2, Q35 and Q36]. =
The=20
applicant should be able to demonstrate that any letters of =
interest/intent=20
identified will be available in less than one year from the date on =
which the=20
CDE enters into an Allocation Agreement [Q36]. Investors should not have =
placed=20
conditions (above and beyond those that were articulated in the business =

strategy) that could adversely impact applicant=92s ability to carry out =
its=20
business strategy [Q37]. The applicant should have a strategy in place=20
(including progress to date) to secure additional investments not =
specified in=20
Tables G1 and G2 [Q38, Table G3]. The applicant should demonstrate that =
it is=20
making excellent efforts to either attract investors that have not =
previously=20
made community development related investments or increase the =
investments of=20
those investors already investing in community development. The =
applicant should=20
offer products/services, which are not offered by its investors [Q41]. =
The=20
applicant should have a plan in place to use QEI proceeds in conjunction =
with=20
other sources of financing for its proposed activities [Q44]. More than =
95=20
percent of the QEI proceeds should be invested in QLICIs [Table H2]. The =

applicant and its subsidiaries should plan to issue at least 90 percent =
of QEIs=20
by 2005, and this strategy should be supported by the narrative for =
transferring=20
QEIs and business strategy [Q46, Q47, Q31].=20
<P><STRONG>Management Capacity</STRONG>=20
<P>There should be no vacancies in key personnel, and the =
organization=92s=20
leadership and management structure shall have been in place for 2 years =
or more=20
[Table J1, Q53]. In-house personnel should conduct all critical =
activities,=20
unless industry standards dictate otherwise. If proposing to invest in =
or lend=20
to real estate QALICBs, development team, consultants/advisors shall =
have worked=20
together before and successfully completed more than one similar project =
[Q51].=20
There should be excellent skills in deploying capital, and relevant =
experience=20
in locating underwriting, and approving QLICIs proposed in Tables B1-E1. =
Skills=20
and experiences should be an excellent match to the individuals=92 roles =
and=20
responsibilities. Experience should indicate a 5+year track record of=20
underwriting QLICIs at a scale that is comparable to projected activity =
listed=20
in Tables B1-E1. A successful track record of deploying investments in =
non-LIC=20
communities should be shown as an excellent indicator that success could =
be=20
transferred to delivery of investments to LIC. The board and management =
team=20
should have appropriate role and task delineation given the business =
strategy=20
and have five years of relevant experience in raising equity from=20
profit-motivated investors and/or non-profit or governmental entities. =
The=20
management team should demonstrate a track record of raising capital =
(with=20
market or near-market repayment terms =96 Table G4) that equals at least =
80=20
percent of the total equity it expects to raise with its NMTC allocation =
each=20
year (Table I1). Key personnel should have experience using tax credits =
to=20
attract capital investors. The applicant (not exclusively engaged in =
Financial=20
Counseling or Other Services) should have experienced staff (minimum of =
five=20
years of asset management experience) and established policies and =
procedures,=20
MIS and other internal systems to effectively manage reporting =
requirements and=20
compliance to both Fund and Investor. The applicant should demonstrate =
an=20
excellent history of meeting compliance requirements of similar programs =
(Table=20
K2). Policies and procedures, and infrastructure (e.g. information =
systems,=20
legal staff, etc) should be in place to ensure compliance with CDE =
Certification=20
and Allocation Agreement requirements.=20
<P><STRONG>Community Impact</STRONG>=20
<P>The applicant=92s strategy should be specifically linked to, and =
contribute to,=20
the particular objectives of at least one other program/designation that =
targets=20
particularly distressed and the hardest-to-serve communities =96 as =
described in=20
narrative to Q66. The applicant=92s strategy should involve working with =

appropriate programs given its overall strategy in Q16. If the applicant =
is a=20
CDFI/SSBIC/ NMVC, it should describe a clear strategy for using QEI =
proceeds to=20
achieve the mission of these programs (Q68). The applicant=92s strategy =
should be=20
targeted to particularly economically distressed communities, where the =
poverty=20
characteristics exceed the LIC thresholds by the three factors listed in =
Q67.=20
The applicant should articulate a clear strategy for targeting such =
areas. The=20
answer provided by the applicant to Q67 should correlate to the answer =
provided=20
in Q18 and, if applicable, Q22a and Q23. The applicant should have a =
structure=20
in place to obtain feedback from LIC residents and local community =
organizations=20
on its products/services and other elements of its investment strategy =
(e.g.,=20
conducting formal surveys/meetings; working through community partners =
to=20
conduct outreach sessions; etc.). Feedback obtained should be actively =
used in=20
support of the applicant=92s NMTC strategy. Feedback mechanisms should =
be seen as=20
appropriate given the applicant=92s Management Capacity and the size of =
its=20
service area (Q69-70). Low-Income Community representatives on the =
governing=20
board or advisory board should play a proactive role either in =
designing,=20
implementing, or monitoring the applicant=92s products and services; or=20
identifying investments; charting new organizational directions for the=20
applicant; etc. The applicant should have clear mechanisms in place to =
consult=20
with Low-Income Community representatives, and mechanisms to allow for =
open=20
dialogue between the applicant and its Low-Income Community =
representatives=20
(Q71). Feedback obtained should be actively used in support of the =
applicant=92s=20
NMTC strategy. The answer to Q71 should correlate to board experience =
described=20
in Q54 and Q56, and board role described in Q55. The applicant=92s NMTC =
strategy=20
should be part of or fit with a community/regional/other redevelopment =
plan=20
already endorsed by a local planning entity or local government (e.g., =
narrative=20
to Q72 should indicate that the strategy has been endorsed by local =
planning=20
entity or local government). The applicant should be able to identify =
more than=20
3 impacts in Q73. The quality of these impacts should be robust and what =
would=20
be expected given the applicant=92s overall strategy in Q16 (especially =
the=20
description of the community=92s needs/ demand) and its =
products/services in Q17.=20
The impacts should be well quantified in Q74, and the applicant should =
promote=20
the sustainability of such impacts (e.g., even after investors sell, =
impacts/=20
activities will remain in community). Based on narrative to Q73, it =
should be=20
demonstrated that the applicant would actually be able to achieve such =
impacts.=20
The applicant should demonstrate that its NMTC products/services would =
help to=20
either further past impacts the applicant has achieved or help it attain =
new=20
ones. The new impacts should be unique to its NMTC strategy, and it =
should be=20
